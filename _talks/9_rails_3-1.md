description: | 
  Another new version of Rails. Delightful. And terrifying. What's changed this time? Fear Not!
  We'll be reviewing the changes and additions to Rails 3.1, giving you a walk-through of what it all means (asset pipeline, what?), in the context of a brand new app, and an older app that will need to be upgraded.
