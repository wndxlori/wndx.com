I haven’t talked about this much but my husband and I are renovating our house. Again. Demolition starts in less than two weeks. 

Last time it was the bedroom level of our four level split house. This time it’s the main level. This level contains the living room, dining room, kitchen, and the main entry to the house. The number of decisions and choices about colours and tiles and wood and cabinets and flooring and layout is endless. One of the things that currently stumping me is the tile for the front entry. As many people do today, I found an example of tile on Pinterest that I wanted to use for this area. Of course, when I showed this to all the tile store staff, everyone rolls their eyes and says that’s so last decade, and we can’t get that stuff anymore.

However, one tile store is working with us, trying to figure out how to re-create this tile style with the materials currently available to us. But now I need to find a pattern for the tiles and I need to visualize what the various colours of tiles that are currently available will look like in that pattern. You’d think with all the different kinds of apps available, I could find something like this in the App Store. A basic version of this wouldn’t even be very difficult to create. And if you wanted to make it really special, let people create their tile pattern using images of currently available tiles, lay it all out, and then use AR (augmented reality) to show them what it would look like on their floor. Now that would be amazing. But, sadly, there are no such apps. I’ll have to cobble things together with the images and photos and pdf’s that I have.

Just another example of “there are so many apps yet to be built!”
