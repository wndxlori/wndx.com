Everything is simple…once you have learned it. The problem is not everyone is at the same point on the learning path that you are when you start writing up documentation, or when you are creating a lesson for a course (ahem).

I have a tendency to look back at course material in the WNDX School and think “this is all so simple”…then I have to remind myself that it looks simple to me, a developer with over 30 years of experience, because I have that entire history of exploring and learning to lean on.

It is very hard to set that experience aside, and look at things again from a beginner’s point of view. This is called the ‘curse of knowledge’ and it is one of the reasons why I value teaching live, in-person when I am first creating a course. I get immediate feedback from questions asked, or looks of confusion, telling me once again that I have failed to overcome the curse.

So, I’d like to tell you—the beginner—to go ahead and ask those questions. Even if you think it’s a dumb question. The truth is, there are no dumb questions, just inexperienced or inflexible people attempting to be instructors.
