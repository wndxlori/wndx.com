OK, so last time we got up to the beginning of 2nd year university, in my CPSC degree program. That was where my dreams of a first class honours degree ended, in a term where I signed up for five science classes. I fell asleep while studying for a math exam that was at 8am, after another late afternoon exam, the previous day. I showed up five minutes into the exam, and was only half prepared. I nailed that half, and utterly failed the rest. Good thing I had also nailed all the assignments and mid-terms for that course, because when I went to the professor’s office to get the final exam results, he looked it up and then said “what the hell happened to you?”. Oh well. The final mark of B+ in that course may have put paid to my first class honours, but I was way more relaxed in the following terms, and enjoyed my university experience much more.

That was also the year that I discovered my people. All CPSC students, some also shooting for the applied math minor. This became my group. I still keep in touch with a couple of them. We shared notes, worked on assignments together, and generally had a great time together. It is entirely possible to work on programming assignments together, and not get accused of cheating or copying each others work. It’s called pseudo-coding. Using paper and pencil, we’d work out the general algorithm of an assignment together, and then go away and all write separate implementations. This was when I also learned the hard lesson that everyone’s minds work differently, and just because someone comes up with a different idea than you, doesn’t mean it’s wrong. Coding is a creative process. Don’t let anyone tell you different.

Hmm. Getting kinda long here, so we’ll leave the other hard lesson I learned at university until next time.
