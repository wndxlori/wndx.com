Last time we wrapped up on the university part of my origin story. Or did we?

Getting that first job coming out of university is both exciting and scary. Exciting, because I would finally have a full time job, probably making more money than my parents ever did. Scary, because…it’s a full time job! What if I make a mistake? What if I hate it?

Most schools have some kind of hiring office, and some kind of job board to go with it. The University of Calgary was no different. Of course, when I was graduating it was an actual board, with actual printed job postings pinned to it with pushpins. So every week after the winter term started we’d wander past the board, make note of the interesting postings, and type up another job application. Yes, with an actual typewriter, which was painful beyond words, but we had to fill in the job application form, and it was a damned folded sheet, so no photocopy would do.

Then we’d have to wait to find out if we got an interview. That was posted on a separate board, with dates and times to show up, so you had to check that one more often. They try to call you, too, but…no cell phones, and most of us didn’t have answering machines either. Anyway, I had a number of interviews to navigate.

One interview always made me laugh. Every year (because summer jobs pretty much worked the same way) this one company picked me for an interview. And every time, the interview would end abruptly when they ‘discovered’ that I didn’t know COBOL. I avoided that language (used primarily by banks, insurance companies and few others) like the plague. Every time I figured they had some other language in mind when they picked me for an interview again. But nope, it was the same story every year.

In the end I received a single good job offer very quickly after the round of interviews. It wasn’t my top pick, but it was the offer I had, so I accepted it. It was a large oil company. As soon as I accepted the offer, I started getting mail from the company with dates and times, and sign ups for all kinds of benefits programs. So it was a bit of a shock to get another job offer from one of my top picks (a high tech company) almost six weeks after I’d accepted the other offer. In my defence, I was young and idealistic (AKA innocent and idiotic), and I figured I had accepted the other job, so I owed it to them to carry through. In retrospect, #largeoilcompany is still going strong and #hightechcompany went belly up years ago, but that doesn’t mean I wouldn’t have learned a lot of more (personally) interesting things if I’d taken that other offer.

And that, my friends, is the lesson from today’s story. You don’t owe a company anything, unless they’ve already started paying you. And even then…no one is going to look out for your best interests except for you. If a better (for you) job comes up, you need to put your own interests up front.
