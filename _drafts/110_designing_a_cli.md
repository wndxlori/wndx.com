As Ruby developers, we use CLI (command-line interface) a lot. Probably more than a lot of other developers. I started reading this article about CLI design out of idle curiosity, but by the end I was truly impressed by the improvements realized by some very subtle changes.

While I spend a lot of time teaching in my 6 Pack Apps program about getting shit done, and getting it out in public quickly, it is worthwhile to spend at least some time considering your audience, and optimizing the experience for them. That could make the difference between a user who likes your app, and one who loves your app.

Maybe some day we’ll get a version of Rake that uses some of this design philosophy. A developer can dream, can’t they?
