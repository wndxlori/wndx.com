Last issue I started my origin story, or how I ended up choosing Computer Science (CPSC) as a profession in high school. This week I’ll continue with my time at university.

Attending the University of Calgary CPSC program, in the early- to mid–80’s, there was virtually no gender imbalance. I think we had about a 55/45 split for men/women. So, that sort of thing wasn’t even a consideration at the time. What was a problem was that I had virtually no experience with computers at all, and felt intimidated by some of my classmates who had home computers (Commodore, Radio Shack, Sinclair and the like) for a couple of years, and experience in BASIC programming.

As it turns out, many of those classmates (largely guys) ended up bored by the Introduction to Programming (in Pascal) CPSC class, and stopped even trying to attend. I just worked hard to get up to speed with what was being taught, and did fairly well. Not to say that I was certain about CPSC. I still had those other professions that I had been advised against (Geophysics, Astrophysics) in the back of my mind and even signed up for the honours physics course (a full year), along with a lot of math. It turns out that if you wanted to graduate with an honours CPSC degree, there was one and only one minor you could qualify for, and still fit in all the course requirements. That minor was Applied Mathematics. So along with my two (half year) CPSC courses in first year, I took four (half year) Math courses and, of course, Physics. Rounded it out with an introductory statistics and a single humanities course in ancient technologies.

That was pretty much an insane course load of almost all sciences. Not recommended. If I could go back in time, I’d tell myself to take it easier, and enjoy the experience of university a little more. But I was taking out student loans to go to school, because the only money I got from my parents was a single $500 Canada Bond that matured each year. While those were way better than no help at all, they didn’t even cover my book expenses each year. So I worked hard in my classes, so I could qualify for scholarships, and minimize my loans.

At the end of my first year of university, I tried to get a programming-related job, but those were few and far between at the time. I ended up back at my parents home for the summer, working retail. Definitely knew that I needed to do better next summer.

As my second year of university started, all of us General Studies students had to declare a major, and pick a faculty. Turns out working hard and getting good grades was necessary, because there were only 200 slots available in the required 2nd year CPSC course, and we’d had over 800 in the first year courses. Most of those guys who’d been bored in the first year classes, and thought they knew everything already, were pretty sad that their barely passing grades weren’t going to get them into the classes they needed. At this point, I entered the Faculty of Science and was pretty much committed to my honours CPSC degree, planning to carry on to a Masters program.

We’ll carry on and finish up the university days next time! Until then, be careful out there.
