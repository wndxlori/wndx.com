For the beginning of my career, the first eight years I worked for a large company. Then I went straight from working for a multinational oil company of many tens of thousands of people (over 500 in IT alone), to a teeny, tiny software company called The WNDX Corporation with only six people in it. Four developers (one on maternity leave), one sales guy and the boss. This introduced me to the concept of ‘culture shock’.

One of the first things that really blew my mind in the new company was computer upgrades. At the large company when you needed a new computer, you had to make the case to your boss. Then your boss decided yay or nay. And then your boss added that computer to next year’s budget, maybe attached to other computer upgrades for other people in your group. Then the boss’s boss would add all that to their budget and tweak the budget up or down according to their needs.

The next year rolls around and a new computer is delivered and set up by IT, and the old computer taken away. But it’s not the computer you asked for and it doesn’t have enough memory, and it’s not worth your job to open up a computer (to add memory) that has an IT asset tag on it.

By way of comparison, my first day at WNDX: “Your computer is over there. Here are some sticks of memory to upgrade it. We’ll get started on showing you the ropes this afternoon.”

Gulp. I’d never opened up a computer before but, hey, I had a screwdriver and a static strap, and I got to work and I upgraded that memory. By the time The WNDX Corporation wrapped up and The WNDX Group rose out of the ashes, I was building my own computers completely from components.

Large companies and small companies work very differently. You will do well to remember that, if and when you make such a switch.
