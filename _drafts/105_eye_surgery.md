And here we go again. In case you haven’t been following the saga of my eye problems, let me quickly bring you up to date:

- August 2020	Macular hole in left eye—result: can’t use my computer, because whatever part of the screen I’m looking at ‘disappears’
- Late September 2020	Eye surgery to repair macular hole
- December 2020	Finally back at work
- February 2021	Left eye develops cataract—90% likelihood after macular hole surgery
- May 2021	Cataract surgery on left eye
- July 2021	Aniseikonia magnification difference between eyes—still can’t work
- September 2021	Right eye contact to counteract aniseikonia—I can work again!
- November 2021	Macular hole in right eye

- Anyway, this time I get to have both corrective procedures (macular hole and cataract lens replacement) in one surgery. By the time you receive this, I’ll actually be one day post-surgery. But it’ll be another month to six weeks before I can read or use a computer (again), so the newsletter will be on hiatus until I get back.

Be good! And by that I actually mean read and follow these guidelines: Understanding Success Criterion 6.1.1: Give a Shit
