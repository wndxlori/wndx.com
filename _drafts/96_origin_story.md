I‚Äôve read a couple of these long Twitter ‚Äòorigin story‚Äô threads now, and really enjoyed them, such has this one by Shahid Kamal Ahmad. I thought I should do that, too. But trying to break it all down into tweet sized bites seems like too much work, so figured‚Ä¶why not in the newsletter?

The first chapter‚Ä¶how it began:

I was a typical math/science geek in high school. I loved math and chemistry and physics. I also loved art. Unsurprisingly, my aptitude tests all skewed heavily towards the sciences. And then I got‚Ä¶‚Äòredirected‚Äô‚Ä¶by my guidance councillors. This was (and still is) not uncommon for girls. They try and steer you away from ‚Äòinappropriate‚Äô careers. üôÑ

First, I wanted to go into geophysics. I was told that I should avoid that. Now I understand, and still disagree, with that advice. Most geophysics graduates in Alberta go straight into the oil patch or mining. But that wasn‚Äôt want I wanted. I wanted to study volcanos. Still kinda regret giving up that dream.

My second choice was astrophysics. I wanted to look for and study extra-solar planets. I was told ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never get a job in that field‚Äù. Later, I learned that NASA recruited out of my university‚Ä¶oh well. Another dream I gave up.

Apparently pure math (my third choice) was a bad idea too. At this point I was getting pretty frustrated, and looked over all the math related career paths and just randomly picked computer science. And they could not find any objections to that.

Note, this was in the early 1980s‚ÄîI graduated in ‚Äò82. My parents were comfortably well off, but not wealthy. We did not have a computer. My school was bringing in a computer class‚Ä¶one year behind me. My sole access to a computer was one of the math teachers‚Äô Apple computer that he brought into his classroom about half way through my senior year of high school. When my spare period lined up with no other class in his classroom, I got to go and play with it a bit, in competition with a lot of other kids.

There was no program for computer science at the University of Lethbridge, my home town, at that point in time, so that‚Äôs how I ended up leaving home and enroling in the University of Calgary, Faculty of General Studies (the only faculty that first year students could enrol in back then).

I think we‚Äôll leave it there, and talk about university days next time.
