Today I have more lessons learned working for a large company. I worked at <large oil company> for almost eight years and I learned a few more useful things while I was there.

First up, I learned how to work with people that I just didnâ€™t like. This is a necessary skill and something that I did not learn gladly, but it has served me well throughout my career. The fact is you canâ€™t always pick who you work with or who you work for so developing some diplomatic skills are important. Especially when the boss picks the one person who really drives you nuts ðŸ¤¦ as your partner on an important project.

Another lesson I learned was: donâ€™t cross the senior execs. I worked for a while for my bossâ€™s boss. She previously had been my direct supervisor and then was promoted one step up the chain. I continued to manage a project management system for her, which on one level required timesheet entry by all the staff, and on another level required reports to be generated and submitted to her (my task). This was simple when she was my direct supervisor, because I was just dealing with my own group of coworkers.

But when she was promoted, the work expanded across all the people who worked for her including other supervisors. At one point I got exasperated by these people (ahemâ€¦supervisors) who would not get their timesheets completed on time for me to produce the reports, and I let one of them know about it. This was a mistake. One does not take that tone (in an email) with someone who is senior to you whether they are in your direct line of management or not. I got slapped down and slapped down hard. It was another lesson I did not learn gladly, but it did teach me to stop and think before hitting the send button on a flaming ðŸ”¥ email.

And the final lesson that I learned was this: when my goals and the companies goals no longer matched it was time to move on. I was offered an opportunity for a new job, a promotion as it were. And in this new job I was going to do exactly the same things that I had been doing for the past couple of years, but it was going to be in a larger group, with a larger user base, and way more pressure. I did not think that taking this job was in my best interests and so I turned it down. This became a serious point of contention with my manager and eventually I was shuffled off to another position where I was able to learn some new things, but it was pretty much a dead-end. And that is where I parted company with <large oil company>.

I say this not because I regret that choice, because I donâ€™t. I did not want to go into management, but I also needed to keep learning new things to be happy and motivated at work, and I was not going to be able to do that in the position and promotion that was offered to me. When the next round of layoffs was announced (thereâ€™d been two others before that, but thatâ€™s a whole different story), I volunteered ðŸ™‹ to be included and I left on my own terms with a nice big payout to add to my retirement fund and help with the downpayment on my first home purchase.
