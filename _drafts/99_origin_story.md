So where were we? Oh yes, I wrapped up second year of university. I had yet to learn my most important lesson. When I started the 3rd year of my program, one of the required 3rd year courses for my honours degree was not being offered. I freaked out, and went to see the honours advisor. Now, the prof who usually was honours advisor was on sabbatical that year, so my appointment was with his backup (can’t remember his name, but he was the database prof).

Armed with the university calendar from my 2nd year (the year I entered the faculty, and thus the ultimate authority on what rules applied to my program), I explained my dilemma. He flipped through the relevant parts of the CPSC program requirements, and the honours requirements, and told me these course lists were only guidelines, not hard and fast rules. He said I didn’t have to take that course, as long as the CPSC department approved my course list every year. Since he was the guy doing the approvals, I handed him my course list, he approved it, and I walked out, full of relief.

Did anyone catch the mistake I made? He gave me advice, telling me I didn’t need to take that course…and I didn’t get it in writing.

Along came 4th year. The regular honours advisor, Dr. V (I won’t use that jackass’s full name) was back, and freaked out. You see, that course that I didn’t take… that was the prerequisite for his baby, the 4th year course Analysis of Algorithms. And he refused to accept my course list for the honours program, since I didn’t have both the 3rd year course (now offered) and his course on my course list.

I complained to the head of the Department of CPSC. He declined to take my side against a tenured prof. The prof who gave me the advice? He was on sabbatical this year, and unreachable. So I took it all the way to the Assistant Dean of the Faculty of Science, as I had a perfect right to do. He read the same part of the calendar, and came to the same conclusion, that those courses were recommendations not requirements, and told me I didn’t have to take that class. Yes…VINDICATION!

A week later, and two days after the last day you could change your class list, I got called back to the Assistant Dean’s office. He was embarrassed. It seems that even though I was right…the guy who had to approve my class list was Dr. V, and he categorically refused to approve it without his class (and the prerequisite) on it. The Dean said I could still proceed with all the classes I was registered in, and would still graduate with a CPSC degree, but without honours. Or, I could cave in and switch classes (he would make it happen, since it was his fault) and get my honours degree. Since my plan was to continue on to a Masters program, and maybe even a Ph.D. (honours was strongly recommended), I bowed my head, and let them rearrange my entire class list. I had to drop the ‘projects’ course, leaving my group in the lurch. And drop the 2nd of two graphics courses, which were my primary interest at the time.

As for my Masters? As I started the process of applying to enter the Masters program later that year, I discovered my advisor for the Masters program would be Dr. V. Nothing could convince me to put up with that pompous ass for another couple of years, so I went ahead and started applying for full time jobs post-graduation.

And I never again trusted anyone about anything important without getting it in writing.
