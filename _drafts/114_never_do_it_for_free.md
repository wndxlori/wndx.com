While the joke pictured above is funny, the underlying concept is so not funny. **Never work for ‘free’**:

- **Not as an Intern** The work interns do is valuable. The novice point of view is valuable. You should expect to be paid as one, and expect to pay for interns when you get to the stage of hiring them.
- **Not for ‘Exposure’** Your work should always benefit you, first. Don’t do work for someone who will benefit monetarily from your work, while you are expected to be happy with something as elusive as ‘exposure’.
- **Not for ‘Open Source’** If you have the time and energy, you can and should donate your efforts back to the community, because you have benefitted from others’ work. And if your employer is benefitting from open source, they should be paying you to work on it. But definitely not working all the free hours of your weekends and evenings because—ra, ra—open source.

Your work and your time are equally valuable. Treat them as such.
