It’s been eight years since my husband and I moved into our ‘forever’ home, and I had kind of forgotten how much moving sucks. I know what you’re thinking…if it’s our forever home, why move? Renovations. Anyway. I’m tired and hot, but we successfully emptied the main level of our house in time for demolition (started today), and moved into a rental for the next few months.

Some people have asked why we didn’t get all the renovations done before we ever moved in, if we knew it needed to change. Honestly, for the same reason that I always tell my clients that they should start small with their apps, and then re-think what they want to add after it’s been out there for a while. Sometimes, you just gotta live with the limitations for a time, so you can really figure out what you need, and not just what you want at first glance. If we had renovated before we moved in, we’d have had a much nicer kitchen, but that’s about it.

After living here for years, and getting familiar with the period that the house was built in, we now have a much clearer vision of what we want, and it’s not just going to be ‘nice’. It’s going to be our very own blend of modern and Mid-Century Modern.

It’s going to be special.
