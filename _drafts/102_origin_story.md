Last time, I talked about accepting an offer for my first job at <large oil company>. I worked at that company for the next seven-and-a-half years, and I learned a LOT of really valuable stuff.

There’s not one piece of specific technical knowledge from that job that I still use today. Not one. But I left that job in 1993, before most people even had ready access to the Internet, much less personal email, so that’s not super surprising. It is a fact that a LOT of larger companies will be a step backward, technology-wise, than you learn at school. And the smaller companies and startups will often be a step ahead.

But I did learn tons about career & personal development that has remained useful throughout my life as a software professional for over 30 years. That’s a benefit of working at a large company that a lot of novice new-hire developers might not recognize up front. I received training on interpersonal relations, public speaking, and time management. I even had some intro stuff on project management (of course that was all waterfall process, but useful for a while).

At the time, I definitely thought a lot of it was a waste of time and effort. Today, I am grateful for it all. I know how to modify my behaviour to negotiate and communicate with all kinds of clients. I can get up on a stage in front of hundreds of people to speak knowledgeably about my work. And I’m working for myself, getting shit done, making plans and prioritizing projects and tasks, day-by-day.

Small companies just don’t have the time or budget to train people at that level. Large companies do, because it’s way cheaper to promote from within, than it is to go looking for talent with those skills outside. The large multinational companies are playing the long game with their staff. Small and startup companies just can’t afford that kind of investment in their personnel.

Something to think about, as you embark on a career in software, or ponder your next move.
