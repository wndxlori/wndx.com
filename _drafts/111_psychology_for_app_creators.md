I found this on Twitter last week and I truly think that these 15 visuals can be specifically applied to many situations, and not just to life in general. For instance…when creating apps.

1) Before you start your app project it always looks overwhelming; when you actually get working on it, it feels a lot like hard work; after you’ve been doing it for a while it actually starts to be fun.

2) This one is a good reminder that starting and failing with your app project a couple of times doesn’t make you a failure; most people who are successful app creators have a lot of failures under their belt, that helped them to earn those successes.

4) It is so true that you don’t need more time to work on your projects; you need more focus.

6) and 7) And finally, discipline and consistency will get you a lot farther over time, than just talent alone will.

Anyway go ahead and look at the rest of the 15 different visuals and see how many of them can apply to you and your career or your app project. I really think most of them do.
