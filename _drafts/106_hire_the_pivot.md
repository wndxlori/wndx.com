“Empowers second career developers to find work. Second career developers have a superpower: pivot skills. Find and hire these superheroes for your company.”

I found this site while convalescing, so today I’m going to take a step back and mention what I was told about a computer science degree when I first chose that profession as a career. I was told that a computer science degree, standing alone, was simply useless, and that I would have to take a second degree in some other field so that I could usefully apply my computer science skills in that other field. This didn’t bother me much at the time, and as it happens that wasn’t true, because of the explosion of need for software professionals. I got a job at <big oil company> immediately out of university. But that oil company spent a lot of time and money training me in the oil industry, and that training was necessary.

And that is something that we lack for the people coming out of college programs and computer science degrees today. Everyone wants ‘experienced’ developers, and people are struggling to get that first job.

But this is even more of an issue for the graduates of boot camps and certificate programs, because they lack that rubber stamp of a degree, and their resumes often get dumped for that lack. Most of these people have a wealth of experience in diverse fields and they can apply some of that experience with their newfound tech skills if someone would just give them a chance. I think that wealth of experience can be worth a lot more than a computer science degree when it comes to boots on the ground building features, and actually understanding what they are building and why.

So next time someone you know is trying to hire an ‘experienced’ software developer for a position, consider if someone with a wealth of experience in that field but no software experience other than their boot camp might not actually be a more effective choice.
