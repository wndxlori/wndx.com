Validating your app idea by talking to your friends and family.  That's so easy.  And so very wrong.  

You see, your
family and friends like you... (well, some of them we hope).  They will be enthusiastic about your app idea
for a couple of reasons, both of them completely useless for validation.  First of all, they like you and 
they don't want to disappoint you, so they'll tell you it's great.  Sort of like when you brought those 
arts and crafts "treasures" you created as a child home and gave them to your mom or dad.  I'm sure they 
were very proud and loudly
proclaimed how beautiful they were. Probably even stuck them to the fridge.

But the truth is, very few of us 
were budding artists, and that stuff we made was mostly ugly crap.  They still feel like they should be 
supportive, and so they'll tell you what you want to hear, instead of giving you a dose of reality.  And if
you go ahead and build that app, I'm sure they'll download it too. The 2 or 3 downloads you get...

Another 
reason they might be supportive of your app idea... again, because they like you, they might get caught up
in **your** enthusiasm. If you are excited and tell a good story, maybe you can convince them it's a great idea.
But your enthusiasm doesn't make it a great app idea. 

Neither of those cases will get you a really good validation endorsement.  What you need is to get **real**
people, your app audience, who will actually **need** your app, to tell you if it's a good or bad idea. Don't go for 
the luke-warm response. You want the people who will say YES, I NEED THAT. 

### Idea Stealing

Ok, let's get real here. "They" aren't out there waiting to steal your app idea. The point of validating 
is to ensure you have product/market fit. If you never 
tell anyone about your idea, never get it out in public, you will never be certain that you aren't wasting 
your valuable time and limited dollars building an app that no one will want. To nail down your 
product/market fit you have to actually talk to people about it. So no building things in secret. 

### Simply Validate

Today, it's easier than ever to validate. You can validate for **free**.  At least, free in terms of having
to pay for services.  YOU still have to come up with your offer.  With [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) you can publish web pages 
for free.  There's even a set of nice [Jekyll themes](https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages) to choose from.  And collecting emails?  You can start 
with [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com), with up to [2000 subscribers for free](https://mailchimp.com/pricing/).  If you can stand up a "coming soon" page for your 
app concept and collect more than 2000 emails, you should **definitely** consider your concept validated.

### Prime that Audience

Don't launch to crickets (or just your dad).

As you collect emails, and you have a lot of people who are interested, then as you start designing
and building your app, you can select from those people, and get them to help you.  They can review your early 
design prototype. They can help you with your user stories. They can beta test your first versions. Getting 
people involved and invested will ensure that your audience is primed and ready when your v1.0 is ready to
go.
