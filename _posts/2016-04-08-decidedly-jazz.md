Recently came across a discussion on Twitter about how programming 
was part math and part jazz.  The jazz part, of course, is about 
improvisation.  I don't know, maybe we are all comedians?

Ok, the basics of the theory are like this.  We use basic building 
blocks, like musicians do, in order to build programs.  These building 
blocks are called "design patterns".  Just like music, we know that 
programs can be built without using design patterns, but they are 
generally more pleasing to read and understand if we do use them. 
These patterns are recognisable to other programmers with the same 
training and understanding.

I remember attending the Toronto Jazz Festival, with my uncle, 
[Don Vickery](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/alone-together/id653166238),
 who happens to be a talented jazz drummer and teacher. There was a French band up on the stage in front of city hall, that 
was... undoubtedly skilled and technically proficient.  But after a 
glance in my direction, my uncle leaned over towards me and said, 
"Yup, my toe is tapping to that one." In case it's not obvious to you, 
that was sarcasm.  Technical proficiency does not necessarily produce 
enjoyable music. I've seen the same thing in code. A talented programmer
can write amazingly complex code to solve difficult problems, but that 
doesn't mean her code is easily readable or even understandable to 
novice programmers. 

Everyone who programs is building something with their mind.  Like music, 
it may be a common melody, that tens or hundreds of composers have used 
before.  Or it may be the craziest new thing ever, that is totally 
unique to that programmer.

Of course, that is the beauty of building things with your mind.
Everyone's mind works differently.  We have schools of thought in 
programming, much like schools of music.  The programs written by people 
of a specific school will tend to be similar, and will definitely be 
more understandable to people of the same school.

But there is value in these differences.  I teach a couple of workshops, 
and I find the endless variations that my students come up with to solve 
the problems presented as exercises fascinating.  In two different 
workshops, I had a couple of sysadmins.  They both approached one of 
the problems (loading a file which had a couple of errors in it) in a 
way that was similar to each other, but totally unique compared to the 
rest of the class of primarily web developers.  Their minds work at 
solving these problems differently, because they have a different 
background and training, and the design patterns they commonly use in 
their work are different from the ones that web developers commonly use. 
That does not mean that their solutions are better or worse than the 
solutions of their fellow classmates.  They were just different.

That's part of what makes programming so interesting.  You can be trying 
to solve a problem, and bring in a coworker or pair to help out, and 
discover a completely new way to approach the problem, because your 
pair just thinks different.  That's incredibly valuable, and programmers 
who are "lone wolves" never experience this sort of revelation.

One of the strengths that I seem to bring to the table is that I can 
approach a problem from many different sides and points of view.  Sure, 
sometimes I get stuck, everyone does.  But having the flexibility to 
recognise that there is more than one approach, and having the mindset 
that allows me to flip from one to another to another is part of what 
makes me a good programmer.  And, I think, a good teacher.  If all you 
know is one way, and one of your students just "doesn't get it", 
because *their* mind doesn't work the same way as yours, it will result 
in an impasse, and a failure to teach.  It's not a failure to learn, 
just because their mind works differently.  As a teacher, you should 
open yourself to all the possible variations of solutions, so that when 
you encounter one of those students, you have other options to use, in 
order to help that student achieve understanding.

And yes, the title of this post IS an homage to the

dance company of my former home, Calgary.
