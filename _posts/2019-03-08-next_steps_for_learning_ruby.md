So I had a discussion about this topic last week with the Adult Programs Manager from 
Canada Learning Code. I love [Canada Learning Code](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca), 
and have volunteered as a mentor and instructor with the 
organization since the Calgary chapter opened its doors, for the
Ladies/Kids/Teachers Learning Code initiatives and briefly as a chapter lead myself, 
down in Lethbridge where I currently reside.

The Canada Learning Code programs do a great job introducing people to coding, and getting
them excited about coding. This is CLC's main focus, and I agree they should stick to it, 
since they do it so very well.


It does however leave a gap. The "next steps" after their introductory courses are left pretty 
much to the learners, beyond some recommended bootcamps for basic web development in the 
larger centers (Toronto and Vancouver). But not everyone lives in the major centers, nor do they necessarily have the money for a 
bootcamp.  And not everyone wants to be a web developer.  


Over the last couple years I've fielded a number of questions from my Ruby learners 
about their "next steps", and I've gathered some resources to have on hand, so I don't 
have to search for them every time.

These are resources for online learning I've collected for people who are just learning 
Ruby, but are not quite at the point where they could fully grasp the material in the 
courses at my [WNDX School](http://wndx.school) for creating mobile applications with RubyMotion.


#### Free

#### Paid

Since not everyone has access to a computer all the time, or can even install things on
the computers they DO have access to, continuing learning on a mobile device or in a browser
is an option, and there are a couple of online Ruby interpreters that you can use in a 
browser:

I hope you find these resources helpful, and if you do, please share this post with others.

Today is [International Women's Day](https://www.internationalwomensday.com/IWD2019), and
this year's theme is #BalanceForBetter. I would love it if more women would join me for the 
[Six Vital Steps from Idea to App Store](http://6packapps.io) webinar. It's free and will 
provide a great introduction to the app development process in about an hour. 

<a href="http://6packapps.io" class="btn btn-xl center">Tell Me More</a>

And then use the 
resources above to learn enough Ruby to come and build [RubyMotion](https://rubymotion.com) 
apps with me. My #BalanceForBetter is to foster the education of a group of more diverse 
women developers, who will be creating the apps of the future that we all use everyday.
