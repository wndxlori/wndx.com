That's right, we now have an official Lethbridge Chapter of the Ladies Learning Code, with an 
[email](mailto:lethbridge@ladieslearningcode.com), and everything.

Back in January, I published my goals for 2015 
[here](http://www.wndx.com/blog/2014-year-in-review-2015-goals), and the fifth goal was the establishment of a Lethbridge chapter for Ladies Learning Code, and to host at least one workshop here in Lethbridge in 2015.

To launch this chapter with a BANG, we are holding our first workshop in conjunction with the 3rd Annual 
[National Learn To Code Day](http://ladieslearningcodeday.com/) on September 26, 2015.  With the help of 
[Facebook](https://facebook.com), 
[Telus](https://telus.com), and the 
Government of Canada we'll be teaching 
[Python](http://ladieslearningcode.com/events/lethbridge/) to absolute beginners!

I can now confirm that our volunteer instructor for the workshop is none other than 
[Jackie Rice](http://directory.uleth.ca/users/j.rice), Associate Dean of the University of Lethbridge, and one of the co-founders of the 
[LUMACS: life, u, mathematics and computer science](http://www.uleth.ca/artsci/math-computer-science/lumacs) outreach program.

And thanks to our wonderful venue sponsor, 
[tecconnect](https://twitter.com/tecconnectab), we also have a great location to host our workshop.

All this is pretty exciting for me.  Many moons ago, when I last re-wrote my website, I added this to my passions:

>I'm also a card-carrying member of DevChix, a teacher at RailsBridge, and a mentor and instructor for Ladies Learning Code (Calgary).  Helping to make a career in software development into a more welcoming opportunity for all women is very, very important to me.

I'm very pleased to add "Chapter Lead (Lethbridge)" for Ladies Learning Code to that list, and I look forward to meeting you all on 
[National Learn to Code Day](http://ladieslearningcodeday.com).  If you have any questions at all, just shoot me an email :
