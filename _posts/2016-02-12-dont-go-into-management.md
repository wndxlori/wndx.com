It was quite a while back, but I saved this tweet, because I thought 
I could write up a fairly epic blog post, related to the topic, so 
here goes.

If you end up working as a developer, for any sort of large corporation,
it is practically inevitable that you will be pressured to go into
management.  This is doubly true for women.  What? you say... Yup,
there is just as serious a gender gap in upper management, to go along
with the gender gap in developer roles.  The powers that be want to get
as big a pool of middle managers as possible to choose from, so they can 
start filling that gap.

Don't do it. Really, if you like to code, you will probably hate
management. And even if you are not certain, I would still say, don't
do it. Mostly because I'm selfish, and I would rather continue to
address the gender gap in developer roles. One of the big reasons for
that gender gap is the number of women who exit the field, before they
can ever advance to "role model" or "mentor". Without more senior women
developers as role models and mentors, the pressure to not hire young
women developers, to allow "brogrammer" culture to flourish, or let
those young women developers transition to "more appropriate" roles
will continue.

I remember being a junior developer at Shell Canada. We were called 
"programmer analysts". Then you got a promotion to "analyst programmer"
(I know, I know). After that came "systems analyst", "senior systems
analyst", "staff systems analyst" and finally "senior staff systems
analyst". This was known as the "technical" track. There was tremendous
pressure, once you got even to "analyst programmer" to start considering
"managerial" type roles. If not straight up management, then project
management, etc. I resisted, because I wanted to be a developer. I love
to create new things. I love to learn new technologies. I enjoy solving
problems. I love to code. Really did not want to be a manager. Finally,
my manager accepted that I wouldn't ever be a manager. So, I was set up
for the "technical specialist" track. First new position in this track
that was offered to me was... "You know this same technology that
you've been working with for 4 years? Ya, so now we want to you move
to a larger group, with more responsibility, more pressure, more
users, and work with this same technology for the next 4 years". I
declined. I wanted something new, something different to learn.
My manager was 100% baffled, and could not understand why I refused
to take the new position. I was 100% baffled as to why she couldn't
see that it had zero appeal to me.

I continued to work at Shell for another couple of years. I even got 
to work on cool things, like a team researching which object oriented 
programming language we should be considering (C++ was in it's infancy, 
but we chose it. Good choice. Obj-C, Eiffel, Smalltalk, etc, wouldn't 
have been good corporate choices in the early 90's). In retrospect 
though, I know that my refusal to take that position was the beginning 
of the end of my career as a "corporate" developer. I couldn't convince 
myself to do what was "good for the company", when all I could see was 
that it would suck all the enjoyment of work out of me.


In the end, I volunteered to be laid off, during one of a series of 
down-sizing exercises. Many of my friends had been laid off in previous
rounds, or quit in between. I ended up, based on a recommendation from
a friend, at a little software company called WNDX. And here I am, over
20 years later, still programming. I mostly still love my work.
Definitely there have been changes and periods of frustration. Every
7-10 years the landscape changes, and if you want to keep coding, you
need to change with it. But then I always loved learning new things,
so that's all to the good.

A few years ago I had lunch with a group of people that I used to work
with and play darts with at Shell. Not one of those people could still
be considered a developer. The ones who were still at Shell (some
were already retired) were quite literally counting the days until
their retirement, while lamenting the stupid little couple million
dollar projects they were working on. I still think that I escaped
just in time. Don't care how sweet that retirement plan was/is.
Nothing can make up for working a job you hate for 20 years.

So, resist that temptation. If you love to code, then find ways to 
keep coding. Work towards being one of those mentors or role models
that our industry needs so badly.
