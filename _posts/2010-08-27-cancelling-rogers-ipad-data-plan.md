After 40 minutes on hold with Rogers (WTF?), I spent a lot of the time attempting to find some way of winkling out the information I needed/wanted out of the email (links galore), and out of Roger's website.  Dad probably didn't want that Rogers account, but now he's got one anyway.  Lots of pissing around later, I discovered this:

>**Cancelling Your iPad Plan**

If you wish to cancel your plan, you must  complete the cancellation process or your credit card will continue to  be charged at the end of each 30-day cycle.  To complete the  cancellation process, select the 
**Settings**
 icon on your iPad home screen, then tap on 
**Cellular Data**
 tab, then tap on the 
**View Account**
 button.


I'll have to do that for my Mom when I'm down in Lethbridge this weekend, and I can dig that useless Rogers card out of her iPad box.  We got Rogers iPad cards for Mom & Dad to use on vacation, and set them all up using Dad's credit card, only to discover that Rogers 3G service is unavailable in Waterton, where they vacation every summer.  I think I stole Dad's Rogers card back... now I have to find it, and put it in MY iPad, and then I can probably cancel his.

Grrrrrrr. Aaaaargh.

Oh, yah, if you are wondering, I got them 2 Telus cards to use in Waterton, and they worked great.  Just cost a lot more, but I learned my lesson and put those cards/accounts on MY credit card.  Should still be good to go for when they visit Victoria in September.  I'll cancel those plans after they get back.
