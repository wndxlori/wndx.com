I'll probably get burned for this, but it's all **my opinion**, based on **my experiences** and 
observations. You may have different opinions, because you have a different career with your own 
experiences.  That doesn't make either of us wrong.  We can agree to disagree. But I'm right.
Anyway let's get to it.  Why RubyMotion for your mobile development?  Why not a mainstream, 
officially blessed language like Swift or Objective C for iOS development?  Like Java or Kotlin 
for Android work?  Or why not Javascript with Ionic/Cordova/React Native?

Let me work my way backwards through these.  

It has to be said... JavaScript is not a great language. It's a popular language, but it's weird.
And not in a weird-wonderful kind of way. In a weird-wtf-are-you-doing-now kind of way. There's a 
lot of JavaScript cheerleaders out there, but even they will, quietly, where not many people will 
hear... admit that JavaScript kinda sucks.  And then there's the whole native-not-native thing.
Developing mobile apps in JavaScript is *not* *native*. Stop pretending it is. Don't @ me.

Moving on... I was a Java developer for many years. Starting in the wild and crazy days of browser 
applets and AWT (Swing, what's that?), it was fun.  Sort of.  I mean, I had a perfectly nice little 
biz going, selling a cross-platform GUI toolkit called WNDX, written in C, until Java came along 
and kicked crap out of that business.  So, I joined the Java bandwagon.  By the end of my 8th year 
as a Java consultant, having progressed from applets and AWT, through Swing, servlets, Struts, 
EJB's, Tomcat, WebLogic, JBoss, and ilk, I had had enough.  I was so sick of programming Java (and 
by that I mean writing XML configuration files), that I was seriously considering quitting 
development altogether.  Then... I discovered Ruby, through the magic of Rails. Sure my first few 
months of code written in Ruby looked a lot like Java, but programming was fun again.  Convention 
over configuration RULES. So, me? Go back to Java...? No. Freakin'. Way.

Kotlin... I have looked at it, and played with it, but it's been influenced way too much by Java 
to make me consider it too seriously. If I had no choice but to choose between Kotlin and Java...
I'd probably shrug and pick Java because it's more familiar to me, and no one has spent time 
convincing me that Kotlin is a better alternative. It's just different.  And using something 
different just because it's newer and not that un-sexy older language... not a good reason.  

Ok, now Swift... as an officially blessed language, it's appealing, but... I've been watching the 
train wreck of this language's development philosophy - move fast and break things - for a little 
too long to find it at all appealing.  Five major revisions in 5 years. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?! I 
accept that my libraries and tools will change fast.  But my language... I expect it to be a 
little more stable, or at least backwardly compatible, than Swift has demonstrated. I've also 
watched people with extensive properties in Objective C attempt to make the transition to Swift, 
and fail, because the language keeps changing half way through the process.  So, no Swift for me 
either. Let me know when you grow up, Swift, and then we'll talk.

Objective C... before there was iPhone and iOS, there was Mac development with Objective C. I was 
contracted to build a Photoshop plugin for a company in Calgary (cool stuff, check it out, 
Perfectly Clear by Athentech), and chose to build that plugin in Objective C and Cocoa, rather 
than C++ and Carbon, because I could already see the way the wind was blowing.  Photoshop may 
have been built with Carbon, but Carbon was on it's way out.  So I used Objective C. Remember when 
I said I used work on a C-based GUI library?  Yah, I still kinda like C. But Objective C... yuck. 
All those '\[' and '\]' and the overly wordy SDKs. 

```objc
NSArray *myColors;
int i;
int count;

myColors = [NSArray arrayWithObjects: @"Red", @"Green", @"Blue", @"Yellow", nil];
count = [myColors count];

for (i = 0; i < count; i++)
        NSLog (@"Element %i = %@", i, [myColors objectAtIndex: i]);
```

Yuck. It's not readable. Not even close. My old 
WNDX C stuff was more readable than that.  IMO, as a developer of over 30 years experience, code 
that's not readable is pretty much impossible to maintain. And it's even harder to maintain/read 
other people's code written in that language. I was as excited as everyone else when the iOS SDK 
was released. Building an iPhone app, what fun! And then, it wasn't fun at all, because it was ObjC. 
And my app just sat there. Ignored. Because I couldn't work up the energy to work on it as a side 
project.

An then ✨ there was RubyMotion. Yo, it's RUBY. Remember? The language created to make developers 
happy? Yah, that one. 

```ruby
my_colors = %w(Red Green Blue Yellow)
my_colors.each_with_index { |color, i| puts "Element #{i} = #{color}" }
```
 
When RubyMotion was released, it made me happy. Because I could do iOS 
development in Ruby.  Sure, there was still that wordy ObjC SDK to interop with, but the RubyMotion 
community stepped up and reduced that pain by introducing gems like BubbleWrap (making iOS SDK's 
more Ruby-like)
 
```objc
NSUserDefaults *defaults = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];
[defaults setInteger:9001 forKey:@"HighScore"];
[defaults synchronize];
```

vs

```ruby
App::Persistence['HighScore'] = 9001
```
 
and RedPotion (a collection of gems like Rails, that help you build iOS apps)

![](/img/original/swapi_potion_screen.png){: .img-responsive .center-block}
 
And I finally got my app built and in the App Store (https://wimby.ca - only in Canada, eh).

Ok, I've confessed. Those are the reasons I choose to do RubyMotion development. Those are the 
reasons **choose** to teach mobile development with RubyMotion. You can make another choice. But, 
come on, why would you? 🤘

If you, too, would like to get an app in the App Store, why not join me for my FREE 
webinar on April 2 where I'll walk you through some of the tips and tricks I have learned?
