When I was first learning about all the ways in which I was failing at sales and marketing for my school, our business coach introduced us to “that guy” who basically sends an email to his list _every single day_. And people stay on his list, because he tells a great story every day. And he manages to make it relate to his business _every time_. My brain almost exploded during this session, because I was struggling to come up with stuff to talk about once a week, and ended up dropping my newsletter back to every other week.

But much like coding, story telling is a skill, and like any other skill it needs to be practiced. At the beginning you suck. And then you start to suck less. Eventually you get to a point where you think “yeah, that’s not bad at all.” I don’t exercise the story-telling skill every day (my head really would explode if I tried) but I have learned how _notice_ stuff happening in my everyday life and relate it to … teaching people how to create and launch apps.

Today’s story came to me last week as I was setting up (as one does) for a _New Year, New Me_ strength training habit. Got my workout planner set up (it’s a spreadsheet that begs to be an app, but that’s _another_ story) and was trying to figure out how to put together a workout on our 20+ year old Bowflex Xtreme SE 2. The Xtreme came with a DVD that has been lost for about 10 years now that illustrated all the exercises and setups. I finally found a PDF manual for the Xtreme, and decided it would be simpler to print the manual, and leave it beside the machine. Of course, then I needed a binder for this 40 page manual (there are a LOT of exercises).

I quickly searched through my shelves, and found a sacrificial binder, from a project I worked on in 1999. It was about the same size document, so the binder was perfect. Now you may be thinking … “Lori, why are you dragging around documentation for a 25 year old project?” I must admit I’ve been unusually resistant to getting rid** of this piece of documentation, because it was a tangible reminder of my last stint as an employee, and as a software architect.

However, nothing can change the fact that it also represents a reminder of _months_ of effort down the drain. In 1999 I created a very complete high level design for a software service called “FIFO (Farm In, Farm Out)” for the oil industry that was shelved and never used. And that made me very angry. Angry at the waste. Given what I was making at the time, it was over $20,000 of wasted effort. And that doesn’t even count the time of all the people I consulted while I was working on the project.

This was 25 years ago, and I wish I could say this doesn’t happen anymore. But that would be a lie. I have a very good friend that I met in that business coaching program I mentioned above. The first conversation we had was when she asked me for advice about her app. The app that she’d spent over $25k on, and still wasn’t ready for release. And in the end was _never released_.

Here’s what I have observed:

1. It’s WAY too easy to get excited about your grand app idea, and;
1. You want it ALL, and;
1. You want it NOW, and;
1. It’s WAY too easy to start throwing money around to get it built, and;
1. Developers aren’t going to say no when you ask for ALL THE THINGS, because … more money is more money

Why does this sort of thing keep happening? Why do people spend so much time and effort and money on their apps for … nothing in the end?

Because one of life's lessons that is mostly learned from <strike>very expensive mistakes</strike> experience, is that sometimes you can’t just throw money at your problems to make them go away. Sometimes it takes a little bit more …

If you'd like to discuss your app idea (or app project in progress) with me, I have a limited number of free consultation spots available for the people on my list. But do it fast, because I have a couple other projects on the horizon and I'll be closing the door on the free sessions shortly.

** Why yes, I did scan that document to save it. I'm **still** not ready to let COMPLETELY go.
