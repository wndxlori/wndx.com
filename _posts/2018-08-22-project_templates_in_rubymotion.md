When you use the `motion create` command of [RubyMotion](https://rubymotion.com), the default behavior is to create a project that builds an iOS application.  But that is only one of many project templates which are available for you to use.

Displaying the help banner of `motion create`, you are presented with a list of the available RubyMotion templates.


```bash
$ motion create --help
Usage:

 $ motion create APP-NAME

      Create a new RubyMotion project from one of the following templates: 
      
        * android
        * flow
        * gem
        * ios (default)
          ---
          description: This template generates a universal iOS app (iPhone, iPad).
        * ios-action-extension
        * ios-admob-rewarded-ads
        * ios-audio-unit-extension
        * ios-broadcast-ui-extension
        * ios-broadcast-upload-extension
        * ios-call-directory-extension
        * ios-content-blocker-extension
        * ios-custom-keyboard-extension
        * ios-document-provider-extension
        * ios-file-provider-extension
        * ios-framework
        * ios-imessage-extension
        * ios-intents-extension
        * ios-intents-ui-extension
        * ios-notification-content-extension
        * ios-notification-service-extension
        * ios-photo-editing-extension
        * ios-share-extension
        * ios-shared-links-extension
        * ios-spotlight-index-extension
        * ios-today-extension
        * ios-watch-app
        * osx
        * tvos
```

As you can see, there are a LOT of templates.  It used to be that these were embedded as part of the RubyMotion command installation.  In recent times, these have been extracted into their own, publicly available, [Github repository](https://github.com/amirrajan/rubymotion-templates).  

When these templates are updated, you can pull the updates down with the `motion repo` command.

If a template has been updated, you will see something like:

```bash
$ motion repo
remote: Counting objects: 7, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 7 (delta 3), reused 6 (delta 3), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (7/7), done.
From https://github.com/amirrajan/rubymotion-templates
   af6cbc5..775e91c  master     -> origin/master
```

Once updated, running the command again is a no-op.

The templates are stored in a "dot" directory, under your home directory.  If you have any problems with these templates, you can always delete this directory, and then run the `motion repo` command to update it again.

```bash
$ ls -al .rubymotion
total 0
drwxr-xr-x    4 lori  staff   128 13 Jun 20:51 .
drwxr-xr-x@ 177 lori  staff  5664 21 Aug 11:47 ..
drwxr-xr-x   11 lori  staff   352 19 Jul 16:06 rubymotion-command
drwxr-xr-x    7 lori  staff   224 13 Jun 20:51 rubymotion-templates
```

The beauty of having these templates in a repository that can be independently updated, is that they are now decoupled from the RubyMotion release cycle.  If a problem crops up, it can be fixed without a full RM regression test, saving days of waiting.

And there are gems that you can install, which will add additional templates to this list, like the [Red Potion](https://github.com/infinitered/redpotion) gem(s), which will add:

```
        * redpotion-template
```

to the list of available templates.

These templates provide a wealth of example implementations for many important iOS application features (like ios-photo-editing-extension), as well as alternative API's for writing apps (like redpotion-template) and writing apps for other devices (like tvos for Apple TV).
