I've been hearing a number of questions, in relation to the National Learn to Code Day workshop, so I thought I should address those questions in a little more detail than you will find on our workshop 
[registration page](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/lethbridge-data-insights-with-python-for-beginners-on-september-26th-tickets-17610786336).

### I don't need to learn to program?

An interesting fact, most people with a computer today have already been programming for years, and they don't even know it.

Do you use Excel? Have you created rows and columns of numbers and summed them up, and entered formulas for calculating more complex results?  Congratulations!  YOU are a programmer. Excel (and other spreadsheet applications like it), does most of the heavy lifting for you, but those calculations and formulae in spreadsheets are another example of a very narrow, focused programming language.

This workshop, unlike a lot of classes you find online, is aimed at the 
absolute beginner. If you know absolutely nothing about coding or computer programming, this is the workshop for you!

### Why not HTML & CSS?

In previous years, the Learn to Code Day workshop has been the Ladies Learning Code HTML & CSS workshop, in which you learn to build a web page.  This is a fun and exciting workshop, if for no other reason than when you leave, you have something you can show off to all your friends & family.

The thing is, HTML & CSS are used to build web pages, and that's about it.

### Why Python?

Python, on the other hand, is a 
general purpose programming language.  What does that mean?  It means that you can use it to create a web application, or you can program your 
[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/learning-python-with-raspberry-pi/) (teeny tiny credit card sized computer) or your your 
[Sphero](https://github.com/faulkner/sphero) robot, or you can crunch numbers like a data scientist!

And by learning how to program with a general purpose programming language, you will find yourself gaining a 
better understanding of how the applications you use on your computer every day, like Excel, actually work and be able to use them more effectively.

### Can guys sign up?

While these workshops are sponsored by 
[Ladies Learning Code](http://ladieslearningcode.com), this is 
[National Learn to Code Day](http://ladieslearningcode.com/codeday/), so guys are welcome, too.  We just ask you guys to bring along a lady!

### How about girls?

We will be offering girls/kids workshops in Lethbridge, too.  In fact, 
[National Girls Learning Code Day](http://girlslearningcodeday.com) is coming up fast.  But if your young lady (11 and up) would really, really like to come to our workshop, they certainly can, but they will need to be accompanied by a parent/guardian.

Here is the link to sign up for the Lethbridge edition of National Learn to Code Day.  Hope to see you there on September 26!

[Lethbridge: Data Insights with Python for Beginners on September 26th](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/lethbridge-data-insights-with-python-for-beginners-on-september-26th-tickets-17610786336)

If you aren't from Lethbridge, go ahead and check the 
[National Learn to Code Day](http://ladieslearningcode.com/codeday/) site for the workshop in your area.

P.S. There's no such thing as too many mentors, so if you already know Python, please consider signing up as a mentor.  It's a lot of fun!
